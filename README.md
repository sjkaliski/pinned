This is a proof-of-concept, date based versioning system for APIs inspired by [Stripe's API versioning](https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning).

## Overview

This package enables reverse compatibility for a Go API by defining versions and their associated changes. Consequently, API versions can be maintained for long periods of time without minimal effort.

## Usage

See the included [example](/example) project for detailed usage.

Versioning is done at a resource/struct level. If a type implements `Versionable` it can take advantage of this package.

1. To start, create a new `VersionManager`.

```go
vm := &pinned.VersionManager{
  Layout: "2006-01-02",
  Header: "API Version",
}
```

2. Then add `Versions`.

```go
// Initial version.
vm.Add(&pinned.Version{
  Date: "2018-02-10",
})

// New version.
vm.Add(&pinned.Version{
  Date: "2018-02-11",
  Changes: []*pinned.Change{
    &pinned.Change{
      Description: "New things",
      Actions: map[string]pinned.Action{
        "Object": someMethod,
      }
    }
  }
})
```

`someMethod` is applied to all `type Object`, and has the signature `func(map[string]interface{}) map[string]interface{}`. 

3. Handle an incoming request.

```go
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // Get version from request.
  v, _ := vm.Parse(r)

  // Set version in context.
  ctx = pinned.NewContext(r.Context(), v)
  
  // ...Fetch resources...

  // Apply version changes to resources.
  body, _ := vm.Apply(v, data)

  // Write response.
  data, err := json.Marshal(body)
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }

  w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
  w.Write(data)
}
```

## Example

Consider the following simple example. An API has a User struct which looks like this:

```go
type User struct {
  ID       uint64
  FullName string
}
```

Now we decide we want to rename `FullName` to `Name`. However, this is a breaking change. To ensure stability, prior to change we set a version `2018-02-10`.

After the change, we set a version `2018-02-11`. This version has a change associated with it. This `Change` has an `Action` to be taken on the `User` resource.

This `Action` is a `func` that _reverses the change_ made in the new version.

```go
func userNameFieldChange(mapping map[string]interface{}) map[string]interface{} {
  mapping["full_name"] = mapping["name"]
  delete(mapping, "name")
  return mapping
}
```

There are now two versions, `2018-02-11` and `2018-02-10`. To support the client that requested version `2018-02-10`, the "changes" made in version `2018-02-11` are undone, and the User resource now reflects the requested version.

As versions are added, these changes are sequentially undone. This enables a version to be supported for a long period of time, and allows the developer to focus on new feature development without much concern towards legacy versions.
